Have you ever seen a new trailer for a movie and thought "wow, that looks like it'll be a good movie!" or "oh man, that looks terrible. I'm not going to see that!" Me too!

Sometimes trailers are a good representation of the actual movie...lately they just blatantly lie to you...but within the trailer you can see signs of a bad movie...or a good movie. Whether it's the depicted tone, the questionable acting, the ridiculous interactions...you can get an impression about the movie. Why not see if you were right?!

Here, you can submit a prediction on how good a movie WILL be based on the trailer (or on the actors[which isn't really a good indication *cough* collateral beauty *cough*]).

For many of us, we rely on critics, or rotten tomatoes to see how good a movie is before we spend our hard earned cash. My favorite "critic" is Chris Stuckkman. I don't always agree with his assessments, but most of the time he introduces me to really good movies that I wouldn't have watched otherwise. Now you can guess what critics scores will be as well! Whether it's Rotten Tomaotes, IMDB, the Guardian, or your favorite youtuber, you can see how good you are!!
